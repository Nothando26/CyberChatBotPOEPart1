# Chatbot description
This C# console application is a Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot designed to educate users on key cybersecurity topics in an interactive and friendly manner. When the program starts, it plays a voice greeting from a local audio file (greeting.wav), displays an ASCII art logo, and shows a colorful welcome banner. The user is then prompted to enter their name, after which the chatbot greets them personally and presents a simple menu-based interaction. Users can type in questions or keywords such as "password," "phishing," or "safe browsing," and the bot responds with helpful tips and explanations. The conversation continues in a loop until the user types "exit" to end the session. The chatbot aims to make cybersecurity knowledge accessible and engaging for everyone.
