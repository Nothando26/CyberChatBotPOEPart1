# Chatbot description
This program is a Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot designed to simulate a natural, flowing conversation with users to help them learn about key cybersecurity topics such as phishing, scams, passwords, malware, privacy, and safety tips. It begins by greeting the user, asking for their name, and checking how they're feeling. Based on the user’s emotional input, the bot responds empathetically—whether the user is confused, curious, anxious, or excited. It then invites the user to ask questions about cybersecurity, where it uses keyword recognition to detect topics and provide tailored responses. For each topic, the bot explains the concept in a friendly tone and offers to share more information if the user is interested. It remembers topics the user says they’re interested in and brings them up later in the conversation to keep the interaction personalized and meaningful. Additionally, it handles errors smoothly by guiding users toward relevant cybersecurity topics and responds appropriately if the user is unsure or confused, asking whether they would like further clarification. Overall, the chatbot creates an engaging, supportive, and educational experience aimed at increasing cybersecurity awareness in a conversational way.



# How to Run the Chatbot

Step-by-Step Interaction
Greeting
The bot greets you with a friendly message and displays some ASCII art and audio effects (if included).

Name Input
You’ll be asked to enter your name. The bot uses this for personalization.

Emotional Check-In
The bot asks how you're feeling (e.g., “I’m feeling curious” or “I’m confused”). It will respond accordingly with empathy or encouragement.

Help Request
The bot then asks, “How can I help you today?” prompting you to ask about cybersecurity topics.

Ask Questions
You can ask things like:

What is phishing?

What are scams?

Tell me about malware.

Give me a tip.

How do I protect my privacy?

How do I use a password safely?

Follow-Up Prompts
After answering, the bot may ask:
"Would you like to learn more about [topic]?"
Respond with “yes” or “no”.

Interest Memory
If you say you're interested in a topic (e.g., “I’m interested in phishing”), the bot will remember it and bring it up later during the conversation.

Sentiment Recognition
If you say something like “I’m confused” during the conversation, the bot will:

Acknowledge your feelings.

Re-explain the last discussed topic (if applicable).

Ask if you’d like further help.

Exit
